# Ansible Role to Deploy NKP Management Cluster on Nutanix

## Overview
This role automates the deployment of a Nutanix Kubernetes Platform (NKP) management cluster in a Nutanix environment.

## What is NKP?
NKP enables organizations to easily overcome Kubernetes Day 2 operational barriers, such as security, observability, reliability, upgradeability, backup and restore, policy management, and governance. This saves time and resources, enabling organizations to operationalize production-ready cloud-native environments in minutes rather than weeks or months.

For more details and NKP pre-requisites, refer to the NKP platform guide.

## Tasks performed by this role:

### 1. NKP Node OS Image Check and Download
- Verifies if the NKP Rocky Linux image is available in Nutanix Prism Central.
- Downloads the image if it is not present.

### 2. Bastion VM Deployment
- Deploys a new bastion VM on the target Nutanix cluster using the downloaded NKP Rocky image.
- Configures the bastion VM with required dependencies using cloud-init.

### 3. NKP Binaries Setup
- Downloads and extracts the required NKP binaries for the specified version on the bastion VM.

### 4. NKP Management Cluster Deployment
- Creates the NKP management cluster using settings defined in the input variables.

### 5. Cluster Access Information
- Once the cluster is successfully created, it prints the dashboard URL along with credentials for login.

## Usage

### Pre-requisites:
Since we are deploying in a Nutanix environment, install the `nutanix.ncp` ansible collection by running the below command on your control node:  

    ansible-galaxy collection install nutanix.ncp

### Steps:
1. Download this role to the Ansible control plane from Ansible Galaxy by running the following command:
    ```sh
    ansible-galaxy role install rathnaarun77.nkp_ansible
    ```

2. Create or download the `inventory.ini` file from this repo and pass it while you run the Ansible playbook, it just contains the localhost so no modifications required.
   ```yaml
   [localhost]
   localhost ansible_connection=local
   ```

3. Below is a sample `playbook.yml` file utilising this role:
    ```yaml
    ---
    - hosts: all
      gather_facts: no
      roles:
        - rathnaarun77.nkp_ansible
      environment:
        ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING: "False"
      vars:
        image_url: ""  # Download URL for NKP Rocky node OS image
        SSH_PUBLIC_KEY: ""  # SSH public key of Ansible control node
        nkp_url: ""  # NKP binary download link for Linux
        NKP_VERSION: ""  # NKP version to install
        CLUSTER_NAME: ""  # NKP cluster name
        NUTANIX_USER: ""  # Prism Central username
        NUTANIX_PASSWORD: ''  # Keep the password enclosed between single quotes
        NUTANIX_ENDPOINT: ""  # Prism Central IP address
        NUTANIX_PORT: "9440"  # Prism Central port
        LB_IP_RANGE: ""  # Load balancer IP range
        CONTROL_PLANE_ENDPOINT_IP: ""  # Kubernetes VIP
        NUTANIX_MACHINE_TEMPLATE_IMAGE_NAME: ""  # NKP Rocky image name
        NUTANIX_PRISM_ELEMENT_CLUSTER_NAME: ""  # Prism Element cluster name
        NUTANIX_SUBNET_NAME: ""  # Example: primary
        NUTANIX_STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME: ""  # Prism storage container 
        DOCKER_USERNAME: "" #Enter your docker username
        DOCKER_PASSWORD: "" #Enter your docker password
    ```

    > ⚠️ **Note:** All the variables are mandatory.

    > **Sample variables**


    ```yaml
    image_url: "https://download.nutanix.com/downloads/nkp/v2.12.2/nkp-rocky-9.4-release-1.29.9-20250409195145.qcow2?Expires=1747167995&Key-Pai........_"  # Download URL for NKP Rocky node OS image

    nkp_url: "https://download.nutanix.com/downloads/nkp/v2.12.2/......"  # NKP binary download link for Linux
    NKP_VERSION: "2.12.2"  # NKP version to install
    CLUSTER_NAME: "mgmt"  # NKP cluster name
    NUTANIX_USER: "admin"  # Prism Central username
    NUTANIX_PASSWORD: '!'  # Keep the password enclosed between single quotes
    NUTANIX_ENDPOINT: "10.38.83.7"  # Prism Central IP address
    NUTANIX_PORT: "9440"  # Prism Central port
    LB_IP_RANGE: "10.38.83.101-10.38.83.101"  # Load balancer IP range
    CONTROL_PLANE_ENDPOINT_IP: "10.38.83.102"  # Kubernetes VIP
    NUTANIX_MACHINE_TEMPLATE_IMAGE_NAME: "nkp-rocky-9.4-release-1.29.9-20250409195145.qcow2"  # NKP Rocky image name
    NUTANIX_PRISM_ELEMENT_CLUSTER_NAME: "PHX-POC311"  # Prism Element cluster name
    NUTANIX_SUBNET_NAME: "primary-PHX-POC311"  # Example: primary
    NUTANIX_STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME: "default"  # Prism storage container 
    DOCKER_USERNAME: "" #Enter your docker username
    DOCKER_PASSWORD: "" #Enter your docker password
    ```
    


4. Finally, to trigger the playbook, run the following command:
    ```sh
    ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml
    ```

5. Once the playbook completes without any errors, you will get the NKP dashboard URL and the login credentials as output of the final task.
